Our waitress wasn ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEU')]
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[([12], 'restaurant general', 'POS')]

A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[([2], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([17], 'food quality', 'POS')]

At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .####[([5], 'service general', 'NEG')]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####[([18], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
I couldn ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####[([-1], 'food style_options', 'NEG')]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####[([-1], 'food quality', 'NEG')]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she didn ' t like it , and I cannot comp it .####[([10], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don ' t put you off –####[([1], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([5, 6, 7, 8], 'service general', 'NEG')]

There ' s another girl who I can ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re *really * talking about .####[([4], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I ' m a friendly person , so I wouldn ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]

Considering you will spend at least $60 a head , I expect better service .####[([13], 'service general', 'NEG'), ([-1], 'restaurant prices', 'NEG')]

The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .####[([1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
I couldn ' t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
